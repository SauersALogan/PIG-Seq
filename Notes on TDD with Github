# Technical note
This repository has two primary goals:
  1) Expand my dev-ops knowledge with both python (using TDD in py.test) and to learn good practice with github dev-ops. 
  2) Develop scripts related to my paired immunologlobulin sequencing technique which provides custom scripts for high quality 
read mapping of paired metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data to sample specific metagenomic assemblies, then maps contigs from these assemblies to
specific metagenomic bins and unbinned contigs. The ultimate output is to hopefully acquire accurate cpm estimates for each gene within binned metagenomes and 
the remaining unbinned metagenomic assembly. 

For test driven developement I will follow the steps below:
  1) I will create test files for core scripts, due to the complex nature and differing requirements not all functions will be within the same script. 
    Technical note, this is essentially an overarching guide that will serve as both a roadmap and an integration test script
  2) These test files will be named with the convention test_XXX.py 
  3) Functions will be saved as function_name.py in the developement folder while developing and before integrating into the integration test
  4) The main script will be saved in the source folder (src) XXX.py

For github based development
